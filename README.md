# Python-learning-journey

---

This repository contains a curated collection of small Python projects created throughout my personal learning and training journey. These projects were originally made for practice and self-improvement, but anyone is welcome to use them for learning, experimenting, or inspiration!

## Topics Covered

- **Structured Programming:**  
  Projects focusing on writing clear, logical, and organized code using functions.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**  
  Examples that demonstrate classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism for better code structure and reusability.

- **File Handling:**  
  Reading, writing, and manipulating text and binary files in Python.

- **Algorithms:**  
  Solutions for common problems such as sorting, searching, and other algorithmic tasks to develop logical thinking.

- **Data Structures:**  
  Implementation and usage of lists, stacks, queues, trees, tables, and other fundamental structures.

- **Additional Python Topics:**
  - Exception Handling
  - Working with Modules & Packages
  - Using External Libraries (e.g., NumPy, pandas)
  - Simple GUI Programming (e.g., Tkinter)
  - Basic Data Visualization (e.g., matplotlib)

## Purpose

- Practice and improve Python programming skills through hands-on projects.
- Gain experience with different problem-solving techniques and approaches.
- Build a solid foundation for more advanced Python development.

## How to Use
