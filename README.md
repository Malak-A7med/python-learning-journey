# Python-learning-journey

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects created during my personal training and learning journey. While these projects were originally made for practice and self-improvement, anyone is welcome to use or learn from them!

>> The projects cover various topics, including:

    - **Structured Programming:**  
      Projects that focus on organizing code with clear logic and functions.
    
    - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**  
      Examples of using classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism for better code structure and reusability.
    
    - **File Handling:**  
      How to read, write, and manipulate files (text and binary) in Python.
    
    - **Algorithms:**  
      Solutions to problems like sorting, searching, and more to develop logical thinking.
    
    - **Data Structures:**  
      Implementation of lists, stacks, queues, trees, tables, and other basic structures.
    
    - **Additional Python Topics:**
      - Exception Handling
      - Using Modules & Packages
      - Working with Libraries (e.g., NumPy, pandas)
      - Simple GUI programming (e.g., Tkinter)
      - Simple data visualization (e.g., matplotlib)
        
## Purpose

      - Practice and improve Python programming skills.
      - Get hands-on experience with different problem-solving techniques.
      - Build a strong foundation for more advanced Python development.
